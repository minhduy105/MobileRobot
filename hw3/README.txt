Hi John, 

This is how you can run my code

For Makov localization, you can run:
python Makov.py

For Monte Carlo localization, you can run:
python MCL.py

Note for my code in case you read it, 
I have "propInMap" variable is the probability of that position in the map, "checkMap" is the representation of that location in the map, so I can move it according to our movement and check to see if its next position is similar to the sensor data.
